The WHO has said there is still a chance of containing the virus if its chain of transmission is broken.

Now, researchers have created a dataset which brings together national surveys from 74 countries, representing 3 million women. For the first time, it allows them to describe trends in demand/use of modern contraceptives alongside social and economic indicators. The data is published in The Lancet Global Health and is authored by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and the World Health Organization. It shows that, over time, women are more likely to have their demand for modern contraception met in countries where gender equality and their educational opportunities improve.Coronavirus Politics: The Comparative Politics and Policy of COVID-19\n",

      "A Special Collection on Advances in Clinical Trial Design for Development of New Treatments for Tuberculosis has been released by PLOS Medicine. This Special Collection, that is now complete with the publication of its last paper, contains a series of articles that articulate the essential new steps in clinical research that will pave the way for the development of future optimal treatment for all forms of tuberculosis. The Collection has been sponsored by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development (IRD-France), and coordinated by Dr Christian Lienhardt, Research Director at IRD-France and Dr Payam Nahid, Professor at University of California, San Francisco, USA.  Development of new TB treatments is very long and costly, and hampered by several methodological limitations. The most commonly touted challenge in TB therapeutics remains the absence of a surrogate marker that can be readily measured and that estimates with adequate certainty the anticipated treatment effect in late stage clinical development. New opportunities are emerging with the recent developments in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics methodologies, novel clinical trial designs, new biomarkers, as well as recent advances in molecular diagnostics. A recently broadened and exciting pipeline of new candidate drugs compels us to revisit our current approaches to TB drug development, and based on the learnings of the last 50 years, to identify and seek consensus on best practices for future TB clinical trial designs.ACOG and SMFM Recommend COVID-19 Vaccination for Pregnant Individuals\n",

      "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced its investigational novel COVID-19 oral antiviral candidate,PAXLOVID™, significantly reduced hospitalization and death, based on an interim analysis of the Phase 2/3 EPIC-HR (Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in High-Risk Patients) randomized, double-blind study of non-hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19, who are at high risk of progressing to severe illness. The scheduled interim analysis showed an 89% reduction in risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization or death from any cause compared to placebo in patients treated within three days of symptom onset (primary endpoint); 0.8% of patients who received PAXLOVID™ were hospitalized through Day 28 following randomization (3/389 hospitalized with no deaths), compared to 7.0% of patients who received placebo and were hospitalized or died (27/385 hospitalized with 7 subsequent deaths). The statistical significance of these results was high (p<0.0001). Similar reductions in COVID-19-related hospitalization or death were observed in patients treated within five days of symptom onset; 1.0% of patients who received PAXLOVID™ were hospitalized through Day 28 following randomization (6/607 hospitalized, with no deaths), compared to 6.7% of patients who received a placebo (41/612 hospitalized with 10 subsequent deaths), with high statistical significance (p<0.0001). In the overall study population through Day 28, no deaths were reported in patients who received PAXLOVID™ as compared to 10 (1.6%) deaths in patients who received placebo.UK authorizes Merck's COVID-19 pill, first country to OK the ‘game-changing’ therapy\n",

User-friendly and easily accessed in almost any area with mobile phone service, the free app is available in seven languages � Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish in the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store.Ending the neglect: inaugural webinar on the new road map, COVID-19 and the road to recovery\n",
      "\n",
      "COVID-19 is set to change the landscape of global public health, with long-lasting economic and social impacts necessitating changes in approaches to tackling neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) that may include rethinking resources and programmatic orientation.�WHO�s upcoming road map for neglected tropical diseases for 2021�2030 proposes a new model of operation,� said Dr Mwelecele Malecela, Director, WHO Department of Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases. �This road map, with its major shifts, is even more relevant in the context of COVID-19 as it promotes resilience, health system strengthening, community participation, equity, country ownership and enhanced partner involvement through integrated, multisectoral collaboration.�During the inaugural webinar on 17 June, two panels will discuss the shifts needed during post-COVID-19 recovery to achieve the road map targets for 2030.The first panel will consider how the global community can build on and use innovative approaches to sustain the progress made thus far.The second panel will explore how to align and coordinate work with countries and stakeholders, enhance multisectoral coordination to achieve the global targets and examine the role of health workers and volunteers across various interventions.A cluster of COVID-19 in Beijing, People�s Republic of China\n",
      "\n",
      "WHO is following up with Chinese authorities about a cluster of COVID-19 cases in Beijing, People�s Republic of China.Today, officials from the National Health Commission and Beijing Health Commission briefed WHO�s China country office, to share details of preliminary investigations ongoing in Beijing.  As of 13 June, 41 symptomatic laboratory confirmed cases and 46 laboratory confirmed cases without symptoms of COVID-19 have been identified in Beijing.The first identified case had symptom onset on 9 June, and was confirmed on 11 June.  Several of the initial cases were identified through six fever clinics in Beijing.  Preliminary investigations revealed that some of the initial symptomatic cases had a link to the Xinfadi Market in Beijing.  Preliminary laboratory investigations of throat swabs from humans and environmental samples from Xinfadi Market identified 45 positive human samples (all without symptoms at the time of reporting) and 40 positive environmental samples.  One additional case without symptoms was identified as a close contact of a confirmed case.All cases are in isolation and under care as needed, and contact tracing is underway.  Genetic sequencing of samples is also underway and rapid sharing of these results is important to understand the origin of the cluster and links between cases. WHO has offered support and technical assistance, as well as requested further information about the cluster and the investigations underway and planned.IOC joins forces with WHO and the United Nations to fight COVID-19\n",

      "On Olympic Day, 23 June 2020, the International Olympic Committee and WHO together with the United Nations launch a partnership to encourage individuals and communities around the world to be #HEALTHYTogether. The three partners and Olympic athletes will spotlight the global collaboration needed to stay healthy and reduce the spread and impact of COVID-19. Olympic athletes will help deliver important public health information, to inspire people to adopt or continue behaviours that will curtail the pandemic and provide information that promotes physical and mental health. The partnership kicks off today with Olympians around the world showcasing various exercises to stay healthy during this time. A WHO survey showed that many people who had severe COVID-19 disease were already living with or at risk for noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). The results emphasize the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle including being physically active, having a healthy diet, and avoiding tobacco and alcohol.WHO speaks at the European Parliament on the COVID-19 response\n",
      "\n",
      "On June 25, WHO Director General Dr Tedros  Adhanom Ghebreyesus and Dr Hand Kluge, Regional Director of WHO Europe, spoke at the European Parliament Committee for Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI) on the fight against COVID-19 and the global response and highlighted the leadership of the European Union during this unprecedented time. �The EU is in a unique position to provide global leadership in defining the �new normal� as part of the global recovery�, Dr Tedros said. He reminded parlamentarians, that �although the situation in Europe has improved, globally it is still getting worse� and he added that �In the first month of this outbreak, less than 10,000 cases were reported to WHO. In the last month, almost 4 million cases have been reported.�.The pandemic is showing how essential it is for governments at all levels, including local governments, to strengthen their capacity for prevention, preparedness and response. But plans for the post-COVID-19 recovery, and to reduce the risk of future epidemics, must go further upstream than early detection and control of disease outbreaks � �they must also lessen our impact on the environment, to reduce risk at the source�, Dr Tedros stressed. WHO discontinues hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir treatment arms for COVID-19\n",
      "\n",
      "WHO today accepted the recommendation from the Solidarity Trial�s International Steering Committee to discontinue the trial�s hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir arms. The Solidarity Trial was established by WHO to find an effective COVID-19 treatment for hospitalized patients.The International Steering Committee formulated the recommendation in light of the evidence for hydroxychloroquine vs standard-of-care and for lopinavir/ritonavir vs standard-of-care from the Solidarity trial interim results, and from a review of the evidence from all trials. These interim trial results show that hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir produce little or no reduction in the mortality of hospitalized COVID-19 patients when compared to standard of care. Solidarity trial investigators will interrupt the trials with immediate effect. For each of the drugs, the interim results do not provide solid evidence of increased mortality. There were, however, some associated safety signals in the clinical laboratory findings of the add-on Discovery trial, a participant in the Solidarity trial. These will also be reported in the peer-reviewed publication. This decision applies only to the conduct of the Solidarity trial in hospitalized patients and does not affect the possible evaluation in other studies of hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir/ritonavir in non-hospitalized patients or as pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis for COVID-19. The interim Solidarity results are now being readied for peer-reviewed publication.WHO experts to travel to China\n",
      "\n",
      "WHO experts will travel to China to work together with their Chinese counterparts to prepare scientific plans for identifying the zoonotic source of the SARS-COV-2 virus. The experts will develop the scope and TOR for a WHO-led international mission. Identifying the origin of emerging viral disease has proven complex in past epidemics in different countries. A well planned series of scientific researches will advance the understanding of animal reservoirs and the route of transmission to humans. The process is an evolving endeavor which may lead to further international scientific research and collaboration globally.PK\u0003\u0004\u0014\u0000\u000el�T\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0012\u0000\u0000\u0000word/numbering.xml��MN�0\u0010�O�\u001d\"��$\u0015 \u00145�\n",

Healthcare workers rely on personal protective equipment to protect themselves and their patients from being infected and infecting others.

      "PWHO Director-General today announced the initiation of the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response (IPPPR) to evaluate the world�s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.In remarks to WHO Member States, Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the Panel will be co-chaired by former Prime Minister of New Zealand Helen Clark and former President of Liberia Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. Prime Minister Clark went to on lead the United Nations Development Programme and President Sirleaf is a recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize.Operating independently, they will choose other Panel members as well as members of an independent secretariat to provide support. �Prime Minister Clark and President Sirleaf were selected through a process of broad consultation with Member States and world experts. I cannot imagine two more strong-minded, independent leaders to help guide us through this critical learning process.� said Dr. Tedros in his speech.At the historic 73rd World Health Assembly in May, Member States adopted a landmark resolution that called on WHO to initiate an independent and comprehensive evaluation of the lessons learned from the international health response to COVID-19.�This is a time for self-reflection, to look at the world we live in and to find ways to strengthen our collaboration as we work together to save lives and bring this pandemic under control,� said Dr Tedros. �The magnitude of this pandemic, which has touched virtually everyone in the world, clearly deserves a commensurate evaluation.�   Dr Tedros proposed that a Special Session of the Executive Board be called in September to discuss the Panel�s progress. In November the Panel will present an interim report at the resumption of the World Health Assembly.In January 2021, the Executive Board will hold its regular session, where the Panel�s work will be further discussed; and in May of next year, at the World Health Assembly, the panel will present its substantive report.The Director-General noted that the Independent Oversight and Advisory Committee for the WHO Health Emergencies Programme will also continue its existing work.�Even as we fight this pandemic, we must be readying ourselves for future global outbreaks and the many other challenges of our time such as antimicrobial resistance, inequality and the climate crisis,� said Dr Tedros. �COVID-19 has taken so much from us. But it is also giving us an opportunity to break with the past and build back better.� WHO and UNICEF warn of a decline in vaccinations during COVID-19\n",
      "\n",
      "The World Health Organization and UNICEF warned today of an alarming decline in the number of children receiving life-saving vaccines around the world. This is due to disruptions in the delivery and uptake of immunization services caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. According to new data by WHO and UNICEF, these disruptions threaten to reverse hard-won progress to reach more children and adolescents with a wider range of vaccines, which has already been hampered by a decade of stalling coverage.The latest data on vaccine coverage estimates from WHO and UNICEF for 2019 shows that improvements such as the expansion of the HPV vaccine to 106 countries and greater protection for children against more diseases are in danger of lapsing. For example, preliminary data for the first four months of 2020 points to a substantial drop in the number of children completing three doses of the vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP3). This is the first time in 28 years that the world could see a reduction in DTP3 coverage � the marker for immunization coverage within and across countries.More than 150 countries engaged in COVID-19 vaccine global access facility\n",
      "\n",
      "Seventy-five countries have submitted expressions of interest to protect their populations and those of other nations through joining the COVAX Facility, a mechanism designed to guarantee rapid, fair and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines worldwide.The 75 countries, which would finance the vaccines from their own public finance budgets, partner with up to 90 lower-income countries that could be supported through voluntary donations to Gavi�s COVAX Advance Market Commitment (AMC). Together, this group of up to 165 countries represents more than 60% of the world�s population. Among the group are representatives from every continent and more than half of the world�s G20 economies.�COVAX is the only truly global solution to the COVID-19 pandemic,� said Dr Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. For the vast majority of countries, whether they can afford to pay for their require assistance, it means receiving a guaranteed share of avoiding being pushed to the back of the queue.  Even for those countries that are able to secure their own agreements with vaccine manufacturers, this mechanism represents, through its world-leading portfolio of vaccine candidates, a means of reducing the risks associated with individual candidates failing to show efficacy or gain licensure.\n",

      "World Health Organization Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus today joined the leadership of Spain, paying homage to those who have lost their lives in the country due to COVID-19, saluting the heroic efforts of heath workers and praising the government�s resolute and robust response to reverse the virus�s transmission.�It is with great respect that I join the King of Spain, the Prime Minister and the entire government of the country to pay tribute to the people who have fallen victim to COVID-19,� said Dr Tedros. �I extend my deepest condolences to the families of all people who have lost their lives due to this virus in Spain, and around the world.�At one point, Spain was among the countries impacted most by COVID-19. At the outbreak�s peak, close to 10 000 new cases were reported in a single day in Spain. Since then, intensive efforts, led by robust surveillance, testing, contact tracing, treatment and isolation, have managed to suppress transmission.Dr Tedros said this shift was due to the leadership shown by Spain and the strong resolve shown by the Spanish public to adhere to strict restrictions, including lockdowns, physical distancing and other critical measures to contain transmission. These efforts, combined, have successfully changed the course of the country�s outbreak.�Spain has shown that with political leadership and action, backed by community support, that COVID-19 can be controlled, no matter at what stage virus transmission is at in a country. From being greatly challenged, Spain has reversed the trajectory of the outbreak,� Dr Tedros added. �While we have witnessed the suppression of the virus across Spain, I support the commitment by Spanish authorities to remain vigilant in the face of the persistent threat that COVID-19 poses.�COVID-19 Emergency Committee highlights need for response efforts over long term\n",

      "The Emergency Committee on COVID-19, convened by the WHO Director-General under the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR), held its fourth meeting on 31 July. In its statement following the meeting, published today, it expressed �appreciation for WHO and partners� COVID-19 pandemic response efforts, and highlighted the anticipated lengthy duration of this COVID-19 pandemic, noting the importance of sustained community, national, regional, and global response efforts.�  After a full discussion and review of the evidence, the Committee unanimously agreed that the outbreak still constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) and offered this advice to Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.Dr Tedros accepted the advice of the Committee and confirmed that the outbreak of COVID-19 continues to constitute a PHEIC. The Director-General declared a PHEIC�WHO�s highest level of alarm under IHR�on 30 January at a time when there were fewer than 100 cases and no deaths outside China. He issued the Committee�s advice to States Parties as Temporary Recommendations under the IHR. �The pandemic is a once-in-a-century health crisis, the effects of which will be felt for decades to come,\" Dr Tedros told the Committee in his opening remarks on Friday. \"Many countries that believed they were past the worst are now grappling with new outbreaks. Some that were less affected in the earliest weeks are now seeing escalating numbers of cases and deaths. And some that had large outbreaks have brought them under control.\" 2 in 5 schools around the world lacked basic handwashing facilities prior to COVID-19 pandemic � UNICEF, WHO\n",
      "\n",
      "As schools worldwide struggle with reopening, the latest data from the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) reveal that 43 per cent of schools around the world lacked access to basic handwashing with soap and water in 2019 � a key condition for schools to be able to operate safely in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.�Global school closures since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic have presented an unprecedented challenge to children�s education and wellbeing,� said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director. �We must prioritize children�s learning. This means making sure that schools are safe to reopen � including with access to hand hygiene, clean drinking water and safe sanitation.�According to the report, around 818 million children lack basic handwashing facilities at their schools, which puts them at increased risk of COVID-19 and other transmittable diseases. More than one third of these children (295 million) are from sub-Saharan Africa. In the least developed countries, 7 out of 10 schools lack basic handwashing facilities and half of schools lack basic sanitation and water services.The report stresses that governments seeking to control the spread of COVID-19 must balance the need for implementation of public health measures versus the associated social and economic impacts of lockdown measures. Evidence of the negative impacts of prolonged school closures on children�s safety, wellbeing and learning are well-documented, the report says.INCB, WHO and UNODC statement on access to internationally controlled medicines during COVID-19 pandemic\n",
      "\n",
      "The International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) call on governments to ensure that the procurement and supply of controlled medicines in countries meet the needs of patients, both those who have COVID-19 and those who require internationally controlled medicines for other medical conditions.There is a need to ensure access to controlled medicines such as sedatives and analgesics for intubation protocols for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. Non-COVID patients continue to require controlled medicines for the management of pain and palliative care, surgical care and anaesthesia, mental health and neurological conditions, and for the treatment of drug use disorders.It is important to remember the needs of existing patients who require controlled medicines for the management of these health conditions. These patients faced barriers to accessing controlled medicines before the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has further resulted in interruptions of the medicines supply chain, and it is critical that access to essential health services and medications not be forgotten or de-prioritised during this pandemic.The Republic of Korea and WHO sign new Memorandum of Understanding, committing US$ 6 million in COVID-19 PCR test kits for 24 countries in the African region\n",
      "\n",
      "On 14 August Korean Ambassador, Ms Ji-ah Paik and WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus signed a new Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with WHO in support of the Organization�s COVID-19 response efforts in the African region. The new MoU follows a recent call between Dr Tedros and Mr Moon Jae-in, President of the Republic of Korea, during which WHO Director-General expressed the need for additional support to scale up the COVID-19 response in the African region. The MoU sets out an in-kind contribution of US$ 6 million in polymerase chain reaction (PCR)  tests / extraction kits to be delivered to 24 countries in Africa in the coming months.  PCR has proven to be a critically important laboratory tool, providing results that are reliable and consistent.�WHO is deeply grateful for this support, which is helping to increase the testing capacity in Africa,� said Dr Tedros. �This tremendous show of support is also strengthening the relationship between WHO and the Republic of Korea. The Republic of Korea is an important partner in global health.�The support of the Republic of Korea follows the successful management of COVID-19 in the country and is now providing support to other countries. The Republic of Korea has a strong background in fighting infectious diseases, including the MERS CoV outbreak in 2015 and the recent outbreak of COVID-19. Leveraging this experience and demonstrating leadership, it has recently launched the Global Support Group for Infectious Disease Response (G4IDR) in Geneva.Global health security and emergency response operations have long been a priority for the Republic of Korea. Dr JW Lee, WHO Director-General from 2003 to 2006, understood the critical need for international cooperation during public health emergencies, for trust, transparency and information sharing among all stakeholders in the global community. The first emergency operations centre, the Strategic Health Operations Centre (SHOC), was established thanks to the vision of Dr Lee. Today the SHOC is the hub of the Emergency Public Health Operations Centres Network, with more than 140 member institutions in over 80 countries around the world.172 countries and multiple candidate vaccines engaged in COVID-19 vaccine Global Access Facility\n",
      "\n",
      "172 economies are now engaged in discussions to potentially participate in COVAX, a global initiative aimed at working with vaccine manufacturers to provide countries worldwide equitable access to safe and effective vaccines, once they are licensed and approved. COVAX currently has the world�s largest and most diverse COVID-19 vaccine portfolio - including nine candidate vaccines, with a further nine under evaluation and conversations underway with other mayor producers.COVAX, the vaccines pillar of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, is co-led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and the World Health Organization (WHO) � working in partnership with developed and developing country vaccine manufacturers. It is the only global initiative that is working with governments and manufacturers to ensure COVID-19 vaccines are available worldwide to both higher-income and lower-income countries.In order to be able to secure enough doses of vaccines to protect the most vulnerable populations, such as health workers and the elderly, the next step for the partnership is to confirm potential self-financing participants� intent to participate by 31 August and to turn these into binding commitments to join the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility (COVAX Facility) by 18 September, with first upfront payments to follow thereafter, and no later than 9 October 2020.�Equal access to a COVID-19 vaccine is the key to beating the virus and paving the way for recovery from the pandemic,� said Stefan L�fven, Prime Minister of Sweden. �This cannot be a race with a few winners, and the COVAX Facility is an important part of the solution � making sure all countries can benefit from access to the world�s largest portfolio of candidates and fair and equitable distribution of vaccine doses.�World Mental Health Day: an opportunity to kick-start a massive scale-up in investment in mental health\n",
      "\n",
      "Mental health is one of the most neglected areas of public health. Close to 1 billion people are living with a mental disorder, 3 million people die every year from the harmful use of alcohol and one person dies every 40 seconds by suicide. And now, billions of people around the world have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which is having a further impact on people�s mental health.Yet, relatively few people around the world have access to quality services. In low- and middle-income countries, more than 75% of people with mental, neurological and substance use disorders receive no treatment for their condition at all. Furthermore, stigma, discrimination, punitive legislation and human rights abuses are still widespread.The limited access to quality, affordable mental health care in the world before the pandemic, and particularly in humanitarian emergencies and conflict settings, has been further diminished due to COVID-19 as the pandemic has disrupted health services around the world. Primary causes have been infection and the risk of infection in long-stay facilities such as care homes and psychiatric institutions; barriers to meeting people face-to-face.Eliminating visceral leishmaniasis: India takes decisive steps to overcome last-mile challenges\n",
      "\n",
      "India recently carried out a high-level independent mission to assess and evaluate its national visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar) strategy. The aim of the independent assessment mission is to identify existing gaps and measure the country�s performance in implementing programmes to achieve the elimination of the disease as a public health problem. �Challenges need to be identified as we resolutely move towards eliminating kala-azar,� said Dr Henk Bekedam, WHO Representative to India. �The importance of an inclusive, pro-poor strategy cannot be underscored as the disease affects marginalized communities. We are confident that this independent assessment by experts will guide the national programme to address remaining bottlenecks.� The first agreement2 to eliminate kala-azar was initiated in 2005 when India, Bangladesh and Nepal, signed the trilateral Memorandum of Understanding. The number of annual reported cases has since decreased from 32, 803 to 3128 in 2019, representing a 90% drop.In WHO global pulse survey, 90% of countries report disruptions to essential health services since COVID-19 pandemic\n",
      "\n",
      "The World Health Organization (WHO) today published a first indicative survey on the impact of COVID-19 on health systems based on 105 countries� reports. Data collected from five regions over the period from March to June 2020 illustrate that almost every country (90%) experienced disruption to its health services, with low- and middle-income countries reporting the greatest difficulties.  Most countries reported that many routine and elective services have been suspended, while critical care - such as cancer screening and treatment and HIV therapy � has seen high-risk interruptions in low-income countries.\"The survey shines a light on the cracks in our health systems, but it also serves to inform new strategies to improve healthcare provision during the pandemic and beyond,� said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. \"COVID-19 should be a lesson to all countries that health is not an �either-or� equation. We must better prepare for emergencies but also keep investing in health systems that fully respond to people�s needs throughout the life course.\"Services hit across the board: Based on reports from key informants, countries on average experienced disruptions in 50% of a set of 25 tracer services. The most frequently disrupted areas reported included routine immunization � outreach services (70%) and facility-based services (61%), non-communicable diseases diagnosis and treatment (69%), family planning and contraception (68%), treatment for mental health disorders (61%), cancer diagnosis and treatment (55%). Countries also reported disruptions in malaria diagnosis and treatment (46%), tuberculosis case detection and treatment (42%) and antiretroviral treatment (32%). While some areas of health care, such as dental care and rehabilitation, may have been deliberately suspended in line with government protocols, the disruption of many of the other services is expected to have harmful effects on population health in the short- medium- and long-term.Potentially life-saving emergency services were disrupted in almost a quarter of responding countries. Disruptions to 24-hour emergency room services for example were affected in 22% of countries, urgent blood transfusions were disrupted in 23% of countries, emergency surgery was affected in 19% of the countries.

      "An international team of scientists has found evidence that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, infects cells in the mouth. While it’s well known that the upper airways and lungs are primary sites of SARS-CoV-2 infection, there are clues the virus can infect cells in other parts of the body, such as the digestive system, blood vessels, kidneys and, as this new study shows, the mouth. The potential of the virus to infect multiple areas of the body might help explain the wide-ranging symptoms experienced by COVID-19 patients, including oral symptoms such as taste loss, dry mouth and blistering. Moreover, the findings point to the possibility that the mouth plays a role in transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to the lungs or digestive system via saliva laden with virus from infected oral cells. A better understanding of the mouth’s involvement could inform strategies to reduce viral transmission within and outside the body. The team was led by researchers at the National Institutes of Health and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.Post coronavirus disease mucormycosis: a deadly addition to the pandemic spectrum\n",
