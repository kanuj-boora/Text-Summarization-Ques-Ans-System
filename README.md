# Text-Summarization-Ques-Ans-System
Created for an experiential learning activity in college.
It was based on coronavirus data from various sources collected by seniors.
Implemented a  text summarization system which keeps sentences based on tf-idf score.
Question-Answering system uses cosin-similarity for finding an answer from the text based on the user query/question.
Unlabelled data was used for both system.
Dataset was provided as a part of the activity by seniors, so it cannot be uploaded along with the project.
